1) the class can be either public(can be accessed outside package) or private(only within pacakage)
2) we require inner classes because we want more than one implementations of the super interface
3)why to make a constructor private: spo that no one can create obj of that class
4) why to make a class final?: so that no one can inherit it
5) static members are not inherited
